## Research question
### What is the research question?
As students, we were interested in a topic that pertained to education, and we are all from different backgrounds, which brought up many issues on how Race and graduation are linked. Thus, we have decided to determine and comprehend if a studentâ€™s Race affects their graduation and what factors into it.

## Description of data
Finding the data was an essential component, as we wanted a city where there are different ethnicities or a town that is known to be very diverse. We chose New York and got the data on high school graduation rates during 2017 from the Department of Education. Also, we focused on the cohort year 2017, which was recent, and the data contains the percentage of dropouts for each Race in that same year.
The data was downloaded from [ New York Department of Education site](https://infohub.nyced.org/reports/academics/graduation-results)
