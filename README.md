# Probability and Statistics Project
## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and modeling data in R to apply the data science research pipeline in a novice-friendly manner. The goal is to engage with data collection, exploration, analysis, and interpretation using a multi-phase approach. The project spans multiple phases, from initial group formation to final report submission, providing insights into statistical modeling with practical data.

## Research question
As students, we were interested in a topic that pertained to education, and we are all from different backgrounds, which brought up many issues on how Race and graduation are linked. Thus, we have decided to determine and comprehend if a studentâ€™s Race affects their graduation and what factors into it.

## Description of data
Finding the data was an essential component, as we wanted a city where there are different ethnicities or a town that is known to be very diverse. We chose New York and got the data on high school graduation rates during 2017 from the Department of Education. Also, we focused on the cohort year 2017, which was recent, and the data contains the percentage of dropouts for each Race in that same year.
The data was downloaded from [ New York Department of Education site](https://infohub.nyced.org/reports/academics/graduation-results)
